py-squaremap-combiner 
======================

|Python 3.12|

Python script written to combine the images generated by the
`squaremap <https://modrinth.com/plugin/squaremap>`__ Minecraft plugin.
Not affiliated with squaremap or its authors.

The seed used for the world the sample images were created from is
``-2590089827693666277``.

Until I release version 1.0.0 I do not consider this project stable —
there are bound to be a number of bugs or quirks that I haven’t
discovered and/or fixed yet, and the code will likely be seeing
frequently large changes until that point. Right now version bumps are
made subjectively and each bump just increases the minor version, but
after 1.0.0 I plan to stick to semantic versioning.

Usage
-----

The script can either be directly run…

.. code:: bash

   python3 squaremap_combine.py my-tiles overworld 2 --output_ext jpg

…or installed as a package
(``pip install git+https://github.com/svioletg/py-squaremap-combiner.git``),
then either imported…

.. code:: python

   import squaremap_combine.squaremap_combine as sq

   combiner = Combiner('my-tiles')
   map_image = combiner.combine('minecraft_overworld', 2)
   map_image.save('output.jpg')

…or run via the ``-m`` switch as its own command.

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m squaremap_combine my-tiles overworld 2 --output_ext jpg

Use the ``-h`` or ``--help`` argument to see full arguments and their
defaults.

Installing this repository as a package is only a convenience feature.
If you don't want to install it, this package only really contains a
single script, so you can download it and use it on its own, provided
you have the required packages installed. The script can be found in
this repository at ``src/squaremap_combine/squaremap_combine.py``.

To find squaremap's tiles, go to the folder your server JAR is in, and
then navigate to ``plugins/squaremap/web``. Inside, there will be a
``tiles`` folder which likely contains folders like
``minecraft_overworld``, ``minecraft_the_nether``, and
``minecraft_the_end``. You will supply the path to this ``tiles`` folder
for the script to work, and then specify a “world” (dimension) to use
the tiles of, which will be one of the three aformentioned subfolders -
the ``minecraft_`` prefix can be omitted when entering them, but you
should not alter the folder names themselves.

After these two, specify what detail level to use, any number from 0
through 3. Level 3 is the highest detail and thus will result in the
largest image, while 0 is the lowest detail and results in the smallest.

====== ========================
Detail Description
====== ========================
3      1 block per pixel
2      2x2 block area per pixel
1      4x4 block area per pixel
0      8x8 block area per pixel
====== ========================

This is all you need to create a basic full-map image. Your command
might look something like this:

.. code:: bash

   python3 squaremap_combine.py server-tiles overworld 3

Note that very large maps can of course easily result in very large
images, and it may take a while for the full image to be completed.

Beyond this, there are various options that can be given to the script
to alter its behavior. If you're not familiar with using the
command-line, these options are typed out after the main command, in any
order, with their associated values following directly after, like
``squaremap_combine.py tiles overworld 3 --option value --option-two value``.
If any of the options below are not used, their **default** is used
automatically.

Options
-------

   Note: You can use either hyphens (``-``) or underscores (``_``) and
   the option will work the same, e.g. ``--output-ext`` or
   ``--output_ext``
