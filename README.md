## Usage

The script can either be directly run...

```
py squaremap_combine.py my-tiles overworld 2 --output_ext jpg
```

...or installed as a package, then either imported...

```python
import squaremap_combine.squaremap_combine as sq

combiner = Combiner('my-tiles')
map_image = combiner.combine('minecraft_overworld', 2)
map_image.save('output.jpg')
```

...or run via the `-m` switch as its own command.

```
py -m squaremap_combine my-tiles overworld 2 --output_ext jpg
```
