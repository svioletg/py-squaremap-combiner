# py-squaremap-combiner

Simple Python script written to combine the images generated by the [squaremap](https://modrinth.com/plugin/squaremap) Minecraft plugin. Not affiliated with squaremap or its authors.

Only requires the `tqdm` and `Pillow` packages, and of course Python. Tested on Python 3.10 and 3.12 (latest version as of writing).
